What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- When you initialize a repository an empty repository gets created. Most of the other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- Staging area is a place where we can add specific files that we can then commit to the repository in just one single commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- You can bundle up all the files that pertain to a one single logical change in the staging area and then commit them at once. Often times files are dependant on each other. For instance, .html and .css files.
